The repository currently includes very basic Python scripts demonstrating:

1. Printing Output
A simple example showing how to print text to the console:

print("Hello World")  # A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
2. Using Imports
An introductory script that demonstrates how to import and use common Python libraries:

random for generating random numbers
math for basic mathematical operations
os for interacting with the operating system
sys for accessing Python runtime information
matplotlib for basic data visualization
The script shows:

Generating a random number
Performing math operations like square roots and factorials
Reading the current working directory and listing files
Printing Python version and command-line arguments
Creating and displaying a simple plot
Purpose
This repository is intended for beginner-level Python learners to:
